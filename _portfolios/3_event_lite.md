Event lite is a 'Event Management System' allows user to let know his friends about the events he hosts and to send invitations to his friends. Friends can either accept or deny the invitaions. A user can also send friend request to other users of the application who can either accept or deny the friend request. Look up mechanism of the app helps the users to look for events to attend and to search a users to be friends.
*img Goal while building this app were to customize **devise**, to get more practice on **rspec, capybara, factory_girl, faker, shoulda-matchers, guard**, to use **twitter-bootstrap**, to add **ajax** along with **searching mechanism***.
