An application for organizations to manage and track various projects. An Employer signs up and invites his employees to join the app to be part of the different projects and tracks the progress of each project. This app allows the employer to choose between two plans based on the needs. 'Free plan' allows employer to have one project to manage whereas
'Premium plan' allows to have unlimited projects.
*My Goal while building this app were to learn **multi-tenancy using milia**, to work on **Dropbox API**, to get more practice on **Stripe API**, to use **bootstrap** along with **<iframe> tags***. Don't forget to check out [README](https://github.com/Sasikala-Ravichandran/project_saas_app){:target="_blank"}{:class="tag_links"} for more information about gems used and features of this app!
