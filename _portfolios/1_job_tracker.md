**Job application Tracking System is designed and built for my family and friends.**
 It allows user to create/maintain a log of job applications to keep track of his job search. It gives ability to upload the documents like resumes, cover letters and so forth to Dropbox. User can use those uploaded documents to create/edit the job application log. It sends remainder mails about the positions which close in another 3 days to know of its status every night. *img Goal while building this app were to configure **ActionMailer and Gmail**, to schedule **cron jobs using 'whenever' gem**, to work with **Dropbox API**, to get more practice on **Stripe API**, to use **bootstrap**, to customize **devise**, to learn **rspec, capybara, factory girl, faker, shoulda-matchers, guard** along with **<iframe> tags***. Don't forget to check out [README](https://github.com/Sasikala-Ravichandran/job_tracker){:target="_blank"}{:class="tag_links"} for more information about gems used and features of this app!
